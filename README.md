# Dream-Travel

The Dream Travel is my project in Software Engineering 2 at Umm Al-Qura University.

The concept behind this project is to create a system that caters to the needs of travel enthusiasts, simplifying the planning process and eliminating the need for extensive research and decision-making. The system accommodates both drivers and travelers, allowing users to book trips and find suitable drivers.

To develop the system, we began by conducting a comprehensive survey to identify the existing gaps in the travel program market and determine the requirements of both users and the system. We then proceeded to create visual representations, including Use Case diagrams, DFD0, DFD1, and Child diagrams. Additionally, we designed Class diagrams, Activity diagrams, and Sequence diagrams for each system function.

For the architectural design, we opted for the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. User scenarios were then written to outline the flow and functionality of each system function. The next step involved interface design and prototype development using SceneBuilder. Finally, we conducted testing using Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure the system's functionality and usability.
